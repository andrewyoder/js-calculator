# js-calculator

A basic calculator web page.

Calculates from left to right, not by order of operations.

If an operator is the last character in the expression string, a default
value of 0 is used for addition/subtraction and a default value of 1 is used
for multiplication/division.

Results that include decimals are trimmed to 5 digits after the decimal--
rounding is not implemented.

To-Do:
 - clean up the calculator using CSS
 - allow keyboard input
 - round results that are too long
